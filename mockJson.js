  "description": "A native of the planet Titan, Thanos saw the danger his people were in from overpopulation and suggested a severe solutionâ€”the elimination of half the population, at random and without prejudice, in order to make life better for the planet as a whole. He was shunned as a madman, but his planet did indeed eventually die, lacking the resources needed to keep up with the demands.",
